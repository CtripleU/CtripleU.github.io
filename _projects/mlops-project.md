This project demonstrates the operationalization of a Machine Learning Microservice API, showcasing essential MLOps practices. The core of the project is a pre-trained sklearn model that predicts housing prices in Boston based on various features. By containerizing and deploying this model, we create a scalable and manageable microservice architecture.

## Why MLOps?

MLOps, or DevOps for Machine Learning bridges the gap between data science and operations, ensuring that machine learning models can be reliably deployed, monitored, and updated in production environments. This project addresses several key aspects of MLOps:

1. **Reproducibility**: By containerizing the application, we ensure that it runs consistently across different environments.
2. **Scalability**: Using Kubernetes allows for easy scaling of the microservice to handle varying loads.
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integration with CircleCI automates the testing and deployment process.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Improved logging helps in tracking the application's behavior and performance.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube)
- CircleCI
- Hadolint
- sklearn (for the pre-trained model)

## Key Features

1. Containerization of a Flask API using Docker
2. Kubernetes deployment for scalable microservice architecture
3. CI/CD pipeline integration with CircleCI
4. Enhanced logging for better monitoring and debugging
5. Scripted environment setup and deployment processes

## Project Structure

- `.circleci/`: Contains CircleCI configuration for CI/CD
- `model_data/`: Holds the pre-trained model and data
- `output_txt_files/`: Logs from Docker and Kubernetes deployments
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the Docker image
- `Makefile`: Defines commands for setup, linting, and testing
- `app.py`: The Flask application serving predictions
- `run_docker.sh`, `run_kubernetes.sh`, `upload_docker.sh`: Scripts for various deployment steps

## Methodology

1. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Create and activate a Python virtual environment
   - Install dependencies using `make install`

2. **Containerization**:
   - Develop and test Dockerfile using Hadolint
   - Build Docker image and run container locally

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**:
   - Set up Minikube for local Kubernetes cluster
   - Deploy containerized application to Kubernetes

4. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Configure CircleCI for automated testing and deployment

5. **Prediction and Logging**:
   - Make predictions using the deployed model
   - Implement and test enhanced logging

## Key Learnings

- Importance of containerization in ensuring consistent environments
- Challenges and solutions in deploying ML models as microservices
- Best practices for CI/CD in ML projects
- Significance of proper logging in microservices architecture

## Future Enhancements

- Implement model versioning and A/B testing capabilities
- Add monitoring and alerting for model performance in production
- Explore cloud deployment options (e.g., AWS EKS, Google GKE)
- Implement automated retraining pipeline for the ML model

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of MLOps principles to deploy and manage a machine learning model effectively. By integrating tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CircleCI, we've created a robust pipeline for model deployment that addresses key challenges in scalability, reproducibility, and maintainability. These practices are essential for organizations looking to leverage machine learning in production environments efficiently.
