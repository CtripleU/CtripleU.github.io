This project applies time series analysis techniques to forecast Bitcoin (BTC) prices, leveraging advanced machine learning models and TensorFlow's powerful data processing capabilities. The aim is to create a robust forecasting system that can capture the complex patterns in Bitcoin's price movements.

Key aspects of the project include:

- Implementing time series forecasting for financial market analysis
- Utilizing TensorFlow and deep learning for price prediction
- Preprocessing and analyzing Bitcoin price data
- Developing and evaluating a stacked LSTM model


Here is a visualization of the model's predictions compared to the actual Bitcoin prices:
