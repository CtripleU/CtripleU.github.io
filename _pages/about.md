Hello! I am a dynamic professional who is deeply interested in how things work, and how they can work better. My interests lie at the intersection of technology, research, and social impact.

Throughout my career, I have excelled in diverse roles spanning Machine Learning, Research, Project Management, and DevOps. I have consistently demonstrated my ability to:

- Master new technologies
- Apply rigorous analytical thinking
- Contribute to technically challenging projects
- Deliver impactful solutions

I am deeply interested in the **healthcare**, **education**, and **business** sectors and am adept at finding opportunities where others might see obstacles in these fields.

Currently in the final stretch of my Software Engineering degree, I am on track to graduate with First-Class Honours. My academic excellence has been recognized through prestigious awards, including the Palantir Global Scholarship in 2024 and the Mastercard Foundation Scholarship in 2021.

**I enjoy working with diverse teams and bringing different perspectives together to create something truly innovative. As a result, I am seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of what could be achieved by harnessing data, technology, and research. My goal is to contribute to projects that will challenge me and push me to grow, while creating something extraordinary.**



Beyond my professional pursuits, I actively volunteer for causes that drive meaningful change by addressing pressing societal issues and empowering individuals and communities. When I am not working or volunteering, you will find me reading a good book or essay, [writing about life](https://journeylessons.substack.com/), enjoying good music, or going on a relaxing walk.

**If you are working on something exciting that sits at the intersection of research and technology, I'd love to chat about how my skills and passion for data-driven solutions can contribute to your team or project! Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cumi-oyemike/)**



Most of my coding-related projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CtripleU),


Thanks for stopping by!
